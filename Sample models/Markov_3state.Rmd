```

# 04 Define and initialize matrices and vectors

## 04.1 Cohort trace

```{r}
# create the cohort trace
m_M <- matrix(NA, 
              nrow = n_t + 1 ,  # create Markov trace (n.t + 1 because R doesn't 
                                # understand Cycle 0)
              ncol = n_states, 
              dimnames = list(0:n_t, v_n))

m_M[1, ] <- c(1, 0, 0)          # initialize first cycle of Markov trace
```

## 04.2 Transition probability matrix

```{r}
# create the transition probability matrix
m_P  <- matrix(0,
               nrow = n_states, ncol = n_states,
               dimnames = list(v_n, v_n)) # name the columns and rows of the transition 
                                          # probability matrix
m_P
```

Fill in the transition probability matrix:

```{r}
# from Healthy
m_P["Healthy", "Healthy"] <- 1 - p_HD - p_HS
m_P["Healthy", "Sick"]    <- p_HS
m_P["Healthy", "Dead"]    <- p_HD

# from Sick
m_P["Sick", "Sick"] <- 1 - p_SD
m_P["Sick", "Dead"] <- p_SD

# from Dead
m_P["Dead", "Dead"] <- 1

# check rows add up to 1
rowSums(m_P)
```

# 05 Run Markov model

```{r}
for (t in 1:n_t){                   # loop through the number of cycles
  m_M[t + 1, ] <- m_M[t, ] %*% m_P  # estimate the state vector for the next cycle (t + 1)
}

```

# 06 Compute and Plot Epidemiological Outcomes

## 06.1 Cohort trace

```{r}
matplot(m_M, type = 'l', 
        ylab = "Probability of state occupancy",
        xlab = "Cycle",
        main = "Cohort Trace", lwd = 3)                 # create a plot of the data
legend("right", v_n, col = c("black", "red", "green"), 
       lty = 1:3, bty = "n")                            # add a legend to the graph

abline(v = which.max(m_M[, "Sick"]), col = "gray") # plot a vertical line that helps identifying at which cycle the prevalence of sick is highest.  
```

## 06.2 Overall Survival (OS)

```{r}
v_os <- 1 - m_M[, "Dead"]             # calculate the overall survival (OS) probability
v_os <- rowSums(m_M[, 1:2])           # alternative way of calculating the OS probability   

plot(v_os, type = 'l', 
     ylim = c(0, 1),
     ylab = "Survival probability",
     xlab = "Cycle",
     main = "Overall Survival")       # create a simple plot showing the OS

# add grid 
grid(nx = n_t, ny = 10, col = "lightgray", lty = "dotted", lwd = par("lwd"), 
     equilogs = TRUE) 
```

## 06.2.1 Life Expectancy (LE)

```{r}
v_le <- sum(v_os)           # summing probablity of OS over time  (i.e. life expectancy)
```

## 06.3 Disease prevalence

```{r}
v_prev <- m_M[, "Sick"]/v_os
plot(v_prev,
     ylim = c(0, 1),
     ylab = "Prevalence",
     xlab = "Cycle",
     main = "Disease prevalence")
```

# 07 Compute Cost-Effectiveness Outcomes

## 07.1 Mean Costs and QALYs

```{r}
# per cycle
# calculate expected costs by multiplying m_M with the cost vector for the different 
# health states   
v_tc <- m_M %*% c(c_H, c_S, c_D)  
# calculate expected QALYs by multiplying m_M with the utilities for the different 
# health states   
v_tu <- m_M %*% c(u_H, u_S, u_D)  
```

## 07.2 Discounted Mean Costs and QALYs

```{r}
# Discount costs by multiplying the cost vector with discount weights (v_dw) 
v_tc_d <-  t(v_tc) %*% v_dwc
# Discount QALYS by multiplying the QALYs vector with discount weights (v_dw)
v_te_d <-  t(v_tu) %*% v_dwe
```

## 07.3 Results

```{r}
results <- data.frame( "Total Discounted Cost" = v_tc_d, 
                       "Life Expectancy" = v_le, 
                       "Total Discounted QALYs" = v_te_d, 
                       check.names = F)
