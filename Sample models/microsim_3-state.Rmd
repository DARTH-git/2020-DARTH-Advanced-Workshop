# 04 Sample individual level characteristics

## 04.1 Static characteristics

```{r}
# randomly sample the sex of an individual (50% female)
v_sex <- sample(x = c("Female", "Male"), prob = c(0.5, 0.5), size = n_i, replace = TRUE) 
df_X  <- data.frame(ID = 1:n_i, Sex = v_sex)
```

## 04.2 Dynamic characteristics 

```{r}
# Specify the initial health state of the individuals 
# everyone begins in the healthy state (in this example)
v_M_init  <- rep("healthy", times = n_i)   
```

# 05 Define Simulation Functions

## 05.1 Probability function

The function that updates the transition probabilities of every cycle is shown below.

```{r}
Probs <- function(M_t, df_X) { 
  # Arguments:
    # M_t:  health state occupied at cycle t (character variable)
    # df_X: data frame with individual characteristics data  
  # Returns: 
    # transition probabilities for that cycle
  
  # create matrix of state transition probabilities
  m_p_t           <- matrix(0, nrow = n_states, ncol = n_i)  
  rownames(m_p_t) <-  v_n  # give the state names to the rows
  
  # lookup baseline probability and rate of dying based on individual characteristics
  p_HD_all <- inner_join(df_X, m_p_HD, by = c("Sex"))
  p_HD     <- p_HD_all[M_t == "healthy", "p_HD"]
  
  # update m_p_t with the appropriate probabilities   
  # transition probabilities when healthy 
  m_p_t[, M_t == "healthy"] <- rbind(1 - p_HD - p_HS, p_HS, p_HD)  
  # transition probabilities when sick 
  m_p_t[, M_t == "sick"]    <- rbind(0, 1 - p_SD, p_SD)          
  # transition probabilities when dead
  m_p_t[, M_t == "dead"]    <- rbind(0, 0, 1)                         
  return(t(m_p_t))
}     
```

## 05.2 Cost function

The `Costs` function estimates the costs at every cycle.

```{r}
Costs <- function (M_t) {
  # M_t: current health state
  c_t <- c()
  c_t[M_t == "dead"]    <- c_D     # costs at dead state
  c_t[M_t == "healthy"] <- c_H     # costs accrued by being healthy this cycle
  c_t[M_t == "sick"]    <- c_S     # costs accrued by being sick this cycle
  
  return(c_t)  # return costs accrued this cycle
}
```

## 05.3 Health outcome function

The `Effs` function to update the utilities at every cycle.

```{r}
Effs <- function (M_t) {
  # M_t: current health state
  q_t <- c() 
  q_t[M_t == "dead"]    <- u_D     # QALYs at dead state
  q_t[M_t == "healthy"] <- u_H     # QALYs accrued by being healthy this cycle
  q_t[M_t == "sick"]    <- u_S     # QALYs accrued by being sick this cycle
  
  return(q_t)  # return the QALYs accrued this cycle
}
```

# 06 Run Microsimulation

```{r}
MicroSim <- function(n_i, df_X, seed = 1) {
# Arguments:  
  # n_i:     number of individuals
  # df_X:    data frame with individual data 
  # seed:    defauls is 1
# Returns
  # a list with information about the individuals transitions, associated costs and 
  # effects and total costs and rewards 
  
  set.seed(seed) # set the seed
  
  # create three matrices called m_M, m_C and m_E
  # number of rows is equal to the n_i, the number of columns is equal to n_t 
  # (the initial state and all the n_t cycles)

      cat('\r', paste(t/n_t * 100, "% done", sep = " "))
    }
    
  } # close the loop for the time points 
  
  # calculate

                  te_hat = te_hat)   
  
  return(results)  # return the results

} # end of the MicroSim function
